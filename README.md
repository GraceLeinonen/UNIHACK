# UNIHACK - It Takes a Village
Welcome to It Takes a Village, a gamified habit tracking app with an emphasis on community and sharing your progress with others! In this game you are placed within a village along with your friends or family, where the state of the village depends on you as a group sticking to your habits. Each house is themed to a specific habit, and interacting with it allows you to view the photos of everyone contributing to that habit. You can also upload your own photos, but miss a day, and the house will fall into disrepair.
